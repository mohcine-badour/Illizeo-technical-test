# Illizeo Technical Test – Fullstack Notes Management App

This project is a full-stack application developed as part of the Illizeo technical test.
It consists of:

* **A Laravel backend**: A secure REST API with authentication (Sanctum), domain-based multi-tenancy, and management of companies, users, and notes.
* **A React/TypeScript frontend**: A modern user interface for authentication, user profile management, and a complete notes management system.

Users can register, log in, manage their company, view company users, and create/update/delete notes.
Each company has fully isolated data.

For installation, configuration, and technical details, refer to:

* `/backend/README.md`
* `/frontend/README.md`
